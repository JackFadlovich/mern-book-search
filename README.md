# MERN: Book Search Engine

## Overview:

The app was built using the MERN stack with a React front end, MongoDB database, and Node.js/Express.js server and API. It's already set up to allow users to save book searches to the back end.

- Set up an Apollo Server to use GraphQL queries and mutations to fetch and modify data, replacing the existing RESTful API.

- Modify the existing authentication middleware so that it works in the context of a GraphQL API.

- Create an Apollo Provider so that requests can communicate with an Apollo Server.


### General Functionality

```
GIVEN a book search engine

WHEN I load the search engine
THEN I am presented with a menu with the options Search for Books and Login/Signup and an input field to search for books and a submit button

WHEN I click on the Search for Books menu option
THEN I am presented with an input field to search for books and a submit button

WHEN I am not logged in and enter a search term in the input field and click the submit button
THEN I am presented with several search results, each featuring a bookâ€™s title, author, description, image, and a link to that book on the Google Books site

WHEN I click on the Login/Signup menu option
THEN a modal appears on the screen with a toggle between the option to log in or sign up

## Description

This project is a full-stack **Google Books API search engine** that allows users to search for books and save them to their own library. Originally built using the **MERN stack** with a RESTful API, it has been refactored to use **GraphQL** and **Apollo Server** for better performance and flexibility.

The application allows users to:
- Search for books using the Google Books API
- Save and manage their favorite books in a personal collection
- Sign up and log in with authentication

## Demo

You can view the deployed application here:  
[Live Demo](https://66e332b6c19b060f2778a9df--mernbookssearch.netlify.app/)

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend:**
  - React
  - Apollo Client (GraphQL)
  - HTML / CSS / JavaScript
  - Bootstrap (for styling)
  
- **Backend:**
  - Node.js
  - Express.js
  - Apollo Server (GraphQL)
  - MongoDB with Mongoose for data persistence

- **Authentication:**
